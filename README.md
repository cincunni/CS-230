The Gaming Room client and their software requirements.
1. Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The client, The Gaming Room, is a company looking to expand their successful trivia game, Draw It or Lose It, to a cross-platform environment. Currently, the game runs on Android, and they want to extend it to support web and iOS platforms while maintaining a consistent experience across all environments. The software needed to be scalable, modular, and capable of supporting multiple game sessions without duplication or conflicts between instances.
2. What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I did a good job clearly organizing the software design document with logical sections that were easy for both technical and non-technical stakeholders to follow. I particularly excelled in the architecture design and component breakdown, which laid out a clear blueprint for future development. I also communicated risks and platform compatibility considerations effectively.
3. What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
Working through the design document forced me to think carefully about the structure of the application before jumping into coding. It helped me identify potential challenges early, such as managing game state and player sessions. The document also served as a helpful reference point to ensure alignment between requirements and implementation as development progressed.
4. If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If I were to revise one part, I would improve the diagrams and visual representations of the system. While the text was clear, more comprehensive UML diagrams or flowcharts would make the document even more accessible to visual learners and easier to maintain over time.
5. How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I interpreted the user's needs by reviewing the client’s core goals: platform consistency, scalability, and maintaining the unique game logic. I translated these into technical requirements such as using a modular architecture and separating business logic from UI components. Considering user needs is crucial because it ensures the software is not just functional, but also usable and aligned with business goals—ultimately leading to better user satisfaction and product success.
6. How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I approached the design using a top-down strategy, starting with the system architecture and gradually breaking it down into smaller components. I used techniques like requirements analysis, platform comparison, and risk evaluation. In the future, I would continue to use these techniques, but also integrate user personas and use-case modeling to better align software features with user behavior.
